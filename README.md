## bio 🐟

I am a sophomore Computer Science student currently working towards a minor in DAS and a certificate in GIS. Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a passion for food blogging and exploring the intersection of data analysis and computer science. I am particularly interested in how these fields can be combined to create engaging and interactive experiences.
